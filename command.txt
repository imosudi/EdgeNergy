Use TensorFlow Lite from full TensorFlow (Recommended)
Replace tflite-runtime with the full TensorFlow package, but use only the lite interpreter:
pip install tensorflow
python# Old import
import tflite_runtime.interpreter as tflite

# New import
import tensorflow as tf
# Use: tf.lite.Interpreter instead
Or keep the same import style:
pythonfrom tensorflow import lite as tflite
